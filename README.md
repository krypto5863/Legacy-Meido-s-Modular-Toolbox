# Legacy-Meido-s-Modular-Toolbox
The little brother of CMI, an AIO installer for CM3D2

Welcome to the Legacy Meido’s Modular Toolbox (for CM3D2)!

Meido can be a very complex game, and we’re here to make it simple. Since the great depression caused by the release of CM3D2, I’ve endeavored to fine tune and keep a clean game setup. This only becomes more difficult as the game ages and the amount of plugins and addons increase. Many issues arise from users making simple mistakes or people who suffer from brain deficits. This installer is supposed to make things quick, easy, simple, safe and clean. You get to pick exactly what you want and discard what you do not and we take care of the rest so you don’t mess it up and you can get in there and enjoy your meidos!
